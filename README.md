Module "Location Based Services" Assignments at University of Zurich


Web app, which shows the user’s current location. This app is an installed shortcut that can be run on a standalone mobile web browser. For
this assignment Leaflet API was used to incorporate map features into the app. The application features a custom marker to display the user's current location and all the restaurant POI’s available
on Open Street Map (OSM). Both location marker and restaurant markers show a popup if clicked. The restaurant markers are clustered when displaying the map on a larger scale:
The colour of the cluster circle depends on the number of restaurants in the region. Green denotes only few restaurants, orange on the other hand signifies that there are many restaurants in a region. Lastly, I added several control elements, such as a toggle to switch the basemaps and to turn on/ off the layers.
